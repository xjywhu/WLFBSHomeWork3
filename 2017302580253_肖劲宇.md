Suppose:  
AAT:Average Access Time  
AID:Average Internet Delay  
ART:Average Response Time  
a. ART= AAT+AID  
AID = 3s  
▲=(850 000/15 000 000)=0.057  
▲β=16*▲=0.907  
AAT = ▲/(1-▲β) = 0.057/(1-0.907)=0.6s  
so ART = 3s+0.6s=3.6s. the **Average Response Time** is 3.6s.     
b. The missing rate is 0.4,so the hit rate is 0.6.  
AAT = ▲/(1-0.4*▲β)= 0.089s  
Because If the cache is hit, the response time is very short and can be ignored.  so:  
ART = (0.089s+3s)*0.4=1.24s.
so the **Average Response Time** is 1.24s.

Suppose:  
NP-Http-RT: None-Persistent Http Response Time  
FTT: File Transmission Time  
PD: one-way propagation delay   
**None-Persistent Http With Pipline:**  

From the figure above we know: 
NP-Http-RT = 2RTT+FTT = (200/150+PD)*3+100 000/150+PD  
Total time taken to deliver 10 objects in parallel:   
Bandwidth reduced to 1 / 10  
T1= (200/(150/10)+PD)*3+100 000/(150/10)+PD    
PD = 10m/(3*10^8m/s)  
The PD is very small, we can ignore.   
Total-time1 = NP-Http-RT+T = 7377 + 8*PD = 7377s  
**Persistent Http**   
Total time taken to deliver 10 objects:    
T2=10*((200+100 000)/150+2PD)  
The PD is very small, we can ignore.  
Total-time2 = (200/150+PD)*3+100 000/150+PD+T2 = 7351s  
**Conclusion**  
It is meaningful to parallelize none-persistent HTTP downloads. It can be seen that the time gap between parallelizing none-persistent HTTP downloads and persistent HTTP downloads is very small, so persistent HTTP downloads do not bring great gains.
